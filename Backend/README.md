# Backend Setup

This is a basic Node.js + Express backend compatible with your Vite React frontend.

## Getting Started

1. Open a terminal in the `Backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the server (development mode with auto-reload):
   npm run dev
   Or for production:
   npm start

The server will run on http://localhost:5000 by default.

## Features
- CORS enabled for frontend-backend communication
- Ready for REST API expansion

## Next Steps
- Add authentication, database, and more routes as needed.
